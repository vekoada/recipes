        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sink your teeth into a sizzling, <em>succulent</em> steak that's perfectly 
            seasoned and cooked to perfection. This mouthwatering recipe features 
            a thick, <em>juicy</em> cut of prime beef, seared to a mouthwatering crust on 
            the outside and tender and pink on the inside. A tantalizing aroma of garlic, rosemary, and thyme fills the air 
            as the steak cooks, complementing the rich, meaty flavor of the beef. 
            As you cut into the steak, the juices flow out, mingling with the savory, 
            charred exterior and creating a taste <em>explosion</em> in your mouth. Every bite is a heavenly experience, as the tender beef melts in your 
            mouth and delivers an burst of flavor that's impossible to resist. 
            Paired with a side of buttery mashed potatoes, this steak recipe is the 
            <strong>perfect</strong> indulgence for any occasion.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large bone-in T-bone <em>or</em> ribeye steak</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable or canola oil </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 sprigs thyme or rosemary <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely sliced shallots <em>(about 1 large; optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully pat steak dry with paper towels. Season liberally 
                on all sides, including edges, with salt and pepper. If desired, 
                let steak rest at room temperature for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron skillet, heat oil over 
                high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add steak and 
                cook, flipping frequently, until a pale golden-brown crust starts 
                to develop, about 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Add butter, herbs (if using), and shallot (if using) to skillet 
                and continue to cook, flipping steak occasionally and basting any 
                light spots with foaming butter. If butter begins to smoke excessively 
                or steak begins to burn, reduce heat to medium. To baste, tilt pan 
                slightly so that butter collects by handle. Use a spoon to pick up butter 
                and pour it over steak, aiming at light spots.</li>
            <li>Continue flipping and basting until an instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into thickest part of tenderloin side registers 120 to 125째F (49 to 52째C) 
                for medium-rare or 130째F (54째C) for medium, 8 to 10 minutes total.</li>
            <li><em>Immediately</em> transfer steak to a large heatproof plate and pour pan juices 
                on top. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Carve, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
