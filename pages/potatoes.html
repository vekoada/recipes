        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2½ pounds potatoes (about 6 large potatoes), 
                preferably a combination of russet (baking) 
                potatoes and large Yukon Golds, or all Yukon Golds</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, more for dotting</li>
            <li>⅓ cup whole milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons salt to 
                a boil over high heat. Peel and quarter potatoes and keep in cold 
                water until ready to cook. (This can be done up to 4 hours in advance.) 
                Add potatoes to boiling water and boil about 15 to 20 minutes, until soft; 
                a knife should go in with almost no resistance. (It is better to overcook 
                than to undercook.)</li>
            <li>In a saucepan or a microwave oven, heat butter and milk together until 
                butter melts and mixture steams. Drain potatoes well and return to pot. 
                Shake them around in the hot pan or over very low heat for a minute 
                (you want dry potatoes). Using an extruding masher or a ricer, mash hot 
                potatoes until smooth, about 2 minutes. Lightly mix in about half of hot 
                butter mixture, just until blended. Taste for salt and add more butter 
                mixture until seasoned to your liking.</li>
            <li>Stop here for fluffy potatoes. For creamy potatoes, keep stirring potato 
                mixture, using a sturdy spoon to press it against sides and bottom of pot. 
                Mix until dense and thick. For whipped potatoes, use a stand mixer to mash 
                hot potatoes just until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add all the butter mixture 
                and salt to taste, pulsing machine in short bursts at medium speed. When light 
                and creamy, stop mixing immediately. (Potatoes can quickly become sticky.)</li>
            <li>To keep hot until ready to serve, transfer to serving bowl, dot top with butter, 
                cover tightly and keep in a warm place, like the back of the stove. Potatoes will 
                stay hot for at least 30 minutes. To keep longer, place covered bowl in a pan 
                holding about an inch of gently simmering water. Before serving, mix well.</li>
